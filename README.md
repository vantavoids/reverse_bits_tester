# reverse_bits tester

Challenge your reverse_bits function with this tester, so the next time you take the exam (and get it) you're gonna rock everything!

## Setup
- Clone this repo
```sh
git clone git@github.com:vantavoids/reverse_bits_tester.git
```
- Create the build directory and move there
```sh
mkdir build && cd build
```
- Generate build system
```sh
cmake ../
```
- Build the thing
```sh
cmake --build .
```
Before actually trying to build it, make sure that you copied / moved your `reverse_bits.c` file at the root of ***this*** repository! Otherwise CMake gonna scream at you. And I personally hate it when CMake screams at me :[

## Run
Simply run `./reverse_bits_enfers` (or `./build/reverse_bits_enfers` depending on your current working directory) and either be proud of yourself for somehow passing this assignment first try or be terrified by all those KO's you're getting (but I know you're way too good at this to fail)
